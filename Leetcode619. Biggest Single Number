Table my_numbers contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.

+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 

For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:

+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |

Note:
If there is no such number, just output null.

Schema: 
Create table If Not Exists my_numbers (num int)
Truncate table my_numbers
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('8')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('8')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('3')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('3')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('1')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('4')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('5')
insert into my_numbers (num) values ('6')

Solution:

select max(r.num) as num from (select num, count(num) as ct
from my_numbers
group by num
order by num desc) as r
where r.ct = 1


select max(r.num) from (select num
from my_numbers
group by num
having count(num) = 1) as r
